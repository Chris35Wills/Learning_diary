# Learning Diary

Following inspiration from @SophMc (see this [repo](https://github.com/SophMC/notechain)) , I thought it would be useful to keep track of some of the things I learn each day. Every day is a learning day and having a clean way of reviewing that learnt in days gone by is useful both for myself and perhaps others. 

This is with regard to smaller code snippets (from whichever language) aside to things posted on [my blog](http://chris35wills.github.io/blog/).
